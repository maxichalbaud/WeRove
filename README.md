## Welcome to WeRove

WeRove is the final project we built for LeWagon bootcamp along with Nicolas Donoso Castex, Analida Corro, and Xenia Boulatnakis.

It consists on a social media platform for travellers, mobile-first (it's actually available as a PWA).

As a user, the first step is to register and build your profile. This includes:
- Your location
- Your interests
- A profile picture

Once you've signed up, you can tell WeRove where you're travelling and the platform will use an algorithm to match you with the best fits for you. You'll be able to accept or reject each of them.

After being matched, you can talk directly with the Local using the built-in chat, or simply look at his/her recommendations for local tourism or experiences, as well as rate them.

You can also just look for recommendations in a specific location without being matched with anyone (we use the same algorithm for this, it's user-based and not recommendation-based).

You can watch a live demo here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SsOzX34TPc&feature=youtu.be&t=1622

## Tech specs

The chat is built using Action Cable.

The whole backend is built with Rails.

We used PostgreSQL as a db and deployed on Heroku.

For the frontend we used Bootstrap, CSS and Javascript ES6.
